### 👋 Hi, I'm Sreeharsha Venkata Sai Kotta

I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer focused on building real-world AI systems that bridge video, language, and cloud infrastructure.

🚀 **What I work on**:
- Action recognition in surveillance (VideoMAE, X3D, SlowFast)
- Abuse detection systems using Whisper + LLMs 
- End-to-end ML pipelines with Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI/CD, and ArgoCD
- Cloud + Edge AI deployments using AWS (EKS, Lambda, S3), MinIO, and RabbitMQ

🎓 **Education**:
- MS in Data Science & Analytics, Georgia State University (GPA: 4.0)
- BTech in Computer Science & Engineering, Shiv Nadar University

🛠️ **Languages & Tools**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, OpenCV, Transformers, SQL, Spark, Azure, AWS, Git, VS Code

📈 Projects include AI-driven video summarization, time-series forecasting, LLM-based NLP analysis, and fraud detection.

🌱 Currently exploring: TinyML for edge devices, multimodal deep learning, and LLM compression techniques.

Let's build something impactful together.
